# Input data and source code for the paper "European Gas Infrastructure Expansion Planning: An Adaptive Robust Optimization Approach"
### I. Riepin, M. Schmidt, L. Baringo, and F. MÃ¼sgens (2021). in review

> The European natural gas market is experiencing structural and fundamental market changes, increasing uncertainty on the supply and demand side. These uncertainties pose questions about the value of strategic infrastructure investments, e.g., the Projects of Common Interest, to ensure supply security. This paper evaluates which of these infrastructure projects are valuable to maintaining system resiliency considering cold-winter demand spikes, supply shortages and availability of investment budget. Additionally, we test whether any other infrastructure expansion projects would be valuable from a system perspective. Methodologically, this paper demonstrates an application of adaptive robust optimization approach to the European gas infrastructure planning problem. The methodology proves its suitability to capture the long-term uncertainty and to identify the critical elements in the gas system.
